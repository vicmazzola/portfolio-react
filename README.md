# My New Portfolio: React + TailwindCSS + TypeScript + DaisyUI

This project is a complete overhaul of my portfolio, built using modern web development tools. It highlights my transition from static development to dynamic, scalable solutions. Here's the journey:

---

## Previous Version
- **Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: Focused on static content and basic interactivity.
- **Manually styled**: Required more time to implement consistent designs across pages.
- **Limited scalability**: Difficult to expand or add new features efficiently.

---

## Current Version
- **React**: Modular and reusable components for dynamic web applications.
- **TypeScript**: Adds type safety for better code reliability and maintainability.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first styling for rapid and consistent designs.
- **DaisyUI**: Pre-styled components to accelerate development while maintaining customization.
- **React Router**: Seamless single-page application navigation.
- **Vite**: Lightning-fast bundler for optimized development and Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

This portfolio not only showcases my technical skills but also represents my growth as a developer, moving from static, manual development to leveraging powerful frameworks and tools for modern web applications.
